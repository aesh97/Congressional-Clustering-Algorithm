# Congressional-Clustering-Algorithm

The problem of clustering a graph to maximize modularity is NP hard. A sub-problem within this one is clustering a social network. This code is an implementation of an algorithm to cluster a social network using data.  


The UI allows the user to pick the US senate they want to explore and then the parition is generated. At the end of the process the % imporovement with respect to partitioning by republican, democrat and  indpendent is shown along with the runtime of the algorithm.
